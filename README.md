# PhiMath

PhiMath is a physics-oriented numerical mathematics library
implemented from first principles using only Python's standard library.

The project focuses on transparency, numerical stability, and
foundational understanding rather than performance or black-box abstractions.

## Current Status
- Numerical control layer implemented
- Core mathematics (constants, series, trigonometry) in progress

## Philosophy
- No external numerical libraries
- Explicit control over precision and convergence
- Designed as a foundation for physics and astrophysics simulations
